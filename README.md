# AP Automation for Visual MFG
An AP Automation application for Infor Visual Manufacturing
The application is a place to store PDF documents created for Purchasing and Accounts Payable.
Much of the data entry is automated using Macros in Visual.

Source code is not ready for public access yet.  Should be ready before 8/1/2020.
I need to convert to a more general code source so that it's not pointing to our custom data or servers.
Written to work with Infor Visual Manufacturing 9.0.1, but should work with all versions.
